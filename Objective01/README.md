### Obejective 01

- Understand and implement the existing algorithm to covert nominal and ordinal data into numerical form.
	- apply the above in the data [done]
	- apply the approach for male and female dataset [done]
	- visualize the distance between samples [done]
	- estimate the cluster number [done]

- Code review [in progress]

## TODOS:
- Merge codebase and document it
- Create 45 deg line to estimate most divergent features
- Create heatmap based on those attributes
