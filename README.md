## Proposal

- To develop machine learning algorithm for visualizing heterogenous multidimentional 
phenomics and genomics data

## Background
Technological advancement in high-throughput experiments (HTE) allow us to decipher 
many biological insights such as, how transcription factor interact with downstream 
genes, with the aid of machine learning algorithms. Machine learning algorithm play a very
vital and integral part of understand complex biological event where we profile
multitude of genes and uncover patterns from it. Most HTE involve experients, where
the phenotype of interest (<strong>X<sub>pheno</sub></strong>) is simple such as (case/control, normal/disease conditions)
and accordingly we developed algorithms to infer genes(<strong>Y<sub>g</sub></strong>) as predictors of the phenotypes (eg., cancer).
In recent years, we started appreciating the fact that other covariate such as
age, sex, environmental conditions along with our phenotype of interest could
play a vital role in regulation within cellular. Overview of phenomics and genomics data is illustrated below in Figure-01.
